## Algorithms with TDD

This repo is dedicated to problem solving in ES5. TDD courtesy of Mocha and Chai.

### Classical algorithms

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Binary Search

TODO:

- Merge sort
- Quick sort

### General problem solving algorithms

- n-queens
- primality check
- rock/paper/scissors combinations
- even occurences
- character frequency
- number to english
- highest contiguous sum

TODO:

- string combinations
- string permutations
- cartesian product
- power set
- implement fibonacci recursively, dynamically, and iteratively
- implement factorial recursively, dynamically, and iteratively
- implement the Towers of Hanoi with 3 towers and N disks
- find all permutations to represent n cents, given 1, 5, 10, 25 cent coins
- print all valid combinations of n-pairs of parentheses

### Time Complexity of sorting Algs

 | Worst | Best | Average |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Selection Sort | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
Insertion Sort | O(n^2) | O(n) | O(n^2)  |
Merge Sort | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn)  | O(nlogn) |
Quick Sort | O(n^2) | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn) |
Binary Search | O(logn) | O(1) | O(logn) |

### Space Complexity

 | Worst | Best | Average |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Selection Sort | O(n) | |  |
Insertion Sort | O(n)|  |  |
Merge Sort | O(n) |   |  |
Quick Sort | O(n) |  |  |
Binary Search | O(1) |  |  |
