### Algorithms with TDD

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search

### Time Complexity

 | Worst | Best | Average |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Selection Sort | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
Insertion Sort | O(n^2) | O(n) | O(n^2)  |
Merge Sort | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn)  | O(nlogn) |
Quick Sort | O(n^2) | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn) |
Binary Search | O(logn) | O(1) | O(logn) |

### Space Complexity

 | Worst | Best | Average |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Selection Sort | O(n) | |  |
Insertion Sort | O(n)|  |  |
Merge Sort | O(n) |   |  |
Quick Sort | O(n) |  |  |
Binary Search | O(1) |  |  |
