### Algorithms with TDD

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search

### Time Complexity

 | Worst | Best | Average |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Selection Sort | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
Insertion Sort | O(n^2) | O(n) | O(n^2)  |
Merge Sort | O(nlog(n)) | O(nlog(n))  | O(nlog(n)) |
Quick Sort | O(n^2) | O(nlog(n)) | O(nlog(n)) |
Binary Search | O(log(n)) | O(1) | O(log(n)) |

### Space Complexity
