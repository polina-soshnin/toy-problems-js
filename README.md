## Algorithms with TDD

### Part 1: sampling of classical algorithms

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search

### Part 2: sampling of interview problem-type algorithms

- n-queens
- primality check
- rock/paper/scissors permutations
- even occurences
- character frequency

### Part 3: sampling of common functional programming methods (ex. Underscore.js)

#### Collections

- first
- last
- each
- indexOf
- filter
- reject
- uniq
- map
- pluck
- reduce
- contains
- every
- some
- shuffle
- invoke
- sortBy
- zip
- flatten
- intersection
- difference

#### Objects

- extend
- defaults

#### Functions

- once
- memoize
- delay
- throttle

### Time Complexity of sorting Algs

 | Worst | Best | Average |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Selection Sort | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
Insertion Sort | O(n^2) | O(n) | O(n^2)  |
Merge Sort | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn)  | O(nlogn) |
Quick Sort | O(n^2) | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn) |
Binary Search | O(logn) | O(1) | O(logn) |

### Space Complexity

 | Worst | Best | Average |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Selection Sort | O(n) | |  |
Insertion Sort | O(n)|  |  |
Merge Sort | O(n) |   |  |
Quick Sort | O(n) |  |  |
Binary Search | O(1) |  |  |
