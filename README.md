- [ ] power set
- [ ] implement fibonacci recursively, dynamically, and iteratively
- [ ] implement factorial recursively, dynamically, and iteratively
- [ ] implement the Towers of Hanoi with 3 towers and N disks
- [ ] find all permutations to represent n cents, given 1, 5, 10, 25 cent coins
- [ ] print all valid combinations of n-pairs of parentheses
- [ ] Sort an array of strings so all anagrams are next to each other
- [ ] Determine if a string contains unique characters
- [ ] Determine if a string is a permutation of another

- [ ] Remove specified characters in a string


- [ ] Given an array of unique words, find the word that contains the greatest number of other words. A word must be at least two letters long.
- [ ] Given an array, find the length of the longest increasing sequence.
- [ ] Given an array of arbitrarily nested arrays, return n, where n is the deepest level that contains a non-array value.
